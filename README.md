| 1    | Set up required technology. Decide on meeting time for the upcoming weeks. Decide features that will go with the app.                                                                                                                           | Go over Git and GitHub with the Odin Project.                                                                                                                                                   | Complete Odin Project until HTML. Begin wireframing app design on Figma with inspiration from Dribbble.                                                                                                   |
| 2    | Continue designing app. Talk about the FKIT stack, how Svelte works, and why we are using it over React/Flutter.                                                                                                                                | **Frontend**: Refine designs while referencing Dribbble and Can't Unsee. **Backend**: Begin following the Fireship tutorial on how to set up FKIT and connect to a database.                    | **Frontend**: Continue with the Odin Project, finishing HTML and CSS. **Backend**: Start learning from the official Svelte tutorial.                                                                      |

| 4    | **Frontend**: Create prototype of website with Svelte. Begin researching ways to make charts in Svelte. **Backend**: Continue working on the database.                                                                                          | **Frontend**: Refine the prototype and gradually flesh it out. Try to simplify your process by using Tailwind and DaisyUI. **Backend**: Finish constructing database and thoroughly testing it. | **Frontend**: Continue fleshing out website. **Backend**: Look for potential deployment options, and whether client-side or server-side rendering is better for the app. (It will likely be client-side.) |
| 5    | **Frontend**: Finish prototype of website and create Quantity and Checklist-type tables. **Backend**: Finish database construction and begin integrating with the front-end.                                                                    | Integrate database with frontend.                                                                                                                                                               | Continue integration.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
